# Font Clock

Very small fonts for digital clocks etc.

Each font is available in a mostly-fixed-width version where
characters are 3 pixels wide with a 1-pixel gap between
characters.  The punctuation symbols can be narrower, but
never wider.

In addition there is a completely fixed width version where
each character takes 4 pixels of width.

Only ASCII and the degree sign are supported.  Some of the
more difficult punctuation symbols like #, @, $, are unreadable.

The 3x5 font is maximally 5 pixels high, and the 3x7 font
is maximally 7 pixels high.  The 3x8 font is identical to
the 3x7 font, but with a one-pixel descender on j, g, p, q
and y.
